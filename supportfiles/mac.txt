Add this snipped to your ~/.zshrc and ~/.bashrc. It allows you not to repeat the flag anytime you perform a docker run command:

# useful only for Mac OS Silicon M1, 
# still working but useless for the other platforms
docker() {
 if [[ `uname -m` == "arm64" ]] && [[ "$1" == "run" || "$1" == "build" ]]; then
    /usr/local/bin/docker "$1" --platform linux/amd64 "${@:2}"
  else
     /usr/local/bin/docker "$@"
  fi
}
